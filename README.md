# 🖥️ GUI

The application is built using **Java Swing**.

The GUI provides:

- File selection
- Compression method selection
- Compress button
- Decompress button
- Progress bar
- Status messages
- Original file size
- Compressed file size
- Compression ratio
- Space saved
- Method used

## 🖥️ Application

The application provides three compression methods:

- **Auto (pick smallest)**
- **Huffman only**
- **LZ77 + Huffman**

Example:

```text
Original Size:       200.10 MB
Compressed Size:     109.34 MB
Space Saved:         45.36%
Compression Ratio:   0.546
Method Used:         LZ77 + Huffman
